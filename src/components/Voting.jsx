// By passing action creators to this method, Redux will inject functions into the component that will
// use creators to create an action and dispatch it to the store
// So all the work is done by Redux: it intercepts the call of vote(enrty) inside Vote component, calls the
// creator function with the same name (vote) and take the generated event and dispatch it to the store
// Then the middleware is in charge of sending this event to the server
